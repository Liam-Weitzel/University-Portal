## What is this?

University-Portal is a fully functional demo university portal web application. The web application is minimalistic in its design and use of CSS ðŸ˜› Three types of accounts can be created which all are able to preform different functions on the web app.
- An admin role, which can administrate the access to the web app and create new courses etc.
- A tutor role, which can authorize students to their courses, edit their courses timetable, take attendance, upload quizzes and documents for the students and record their answers.
- A student role, which is able to interact with the timetable, attendance, progress and documents pages to follow their courses.

## Demo

## Installation

All you need is an Apache webserver, PHP, and MariaDB. All of these are included in WAMP: https://www.wampserver.com/en/.
Once WAMP is installed, clone the repo, and paste it in your WWW folder. Next, execute the localhost.sql file on your instance of MariaDB. Now everything should work as intended :)
