## Installation

All you need is an Apache webserver, PHP, and MariaDB. All of these are included in WAMP: https://www.wampserver.com/en/.
Once WAMP is installed, clone the repo, and paste it in your WWW folder. Next, execute the localhost.sql file on your instance of MariaDB. Now everything should work as intended :)
